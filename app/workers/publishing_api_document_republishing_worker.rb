# This worker synchronises the state of the editions for a document with the
# publishing-api. It sends the current live Edition and the draft Edition.
#
# It is important that the requests are sent in the right order. If the
# pre_publication_edition is sent and then a publish request is sent, the wrong
# draft gets published. If the pre_publication_edition is sent and then the
# live_edition is sent and published, then the pre_publication_edition is
# lost.
#
# The design of the publishing-api means that it is impossible to republish
# something that currently has a draft without having to store the current draft
# and sending it again after republishing. This also changes the version
# numbering and would probably appear in the version history.
